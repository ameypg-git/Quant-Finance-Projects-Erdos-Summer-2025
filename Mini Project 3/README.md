# ðŸ“ˆ Black-Scholes Option Pricing Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the behavior of **European call and put option prices** using the **Black-Scholes model**. The analysis is part of the *Mini Project 3* for the course:

**2025 Introduction to Quantitative Methods in Finance**  
**ErdÃ¶s Institute**

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The notebook investigates:

- How option prices vary with **time to expiration**
- How option prices respond to **changes in the initial stock price ($S_0$)**
- The numerical calculation of **Theta** and **Delta** (rates of change)
- Visual interpretation of pricing behavior

## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts

- **Call Option:** Right to buy the asset at strike price before expiration  
- **Put Option:** Right to sell the asset at strike price before expiration  
- **Theta:** Measures time decay of option value  
- **Delta:** Measures sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset price  
- **Black-Scholes Formula:** Analytical pricing model for European options
