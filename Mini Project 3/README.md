#  Mini Project 3 : Black Scholes Option Pricing Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the behavior of **European call and put option prices** using the **Black Scholes model**.

##  Objective

The primary goal is to analyze how option prices respond to changes in two critical inputs:

- **Time to expiration**  
- **Initial stock price** ($S_0$)

This project helps build intuition around **option sensitivity metrics** like **Theta** (time decay) and **Delta** (price sensitivity).

---

##  Task Breakdown

The assignment consists of four parts:

### **a)** Time Sensitivity of Call Options  
- Visualize how the **Black Scholes call option price** changes with time to expiration.  
- Interpret how the **rate of change** (Theta) behaves as expiration approaches.

### **b)** Spot Price Sensitivity of Call Options  
- Analyze how the **call option price** responds to different initial stock prices $S_0$.  
- Visualize and interpret the **rate of change** (Delta) with respect to $S_0$.

### **c)** Repeat (a) and (b) for **Put Options**  
- Generate the same visualizations and interpretations for **put option prices**.

### **d)** Observations and Reflections  
- Summarize key takeaways from the visual analyses.  
- Compare the behavior of calls and puts with respect to time and spot price sensitivity.

##  Deliverables

-  A fully annotated Jupyter notebook 
-  Graphs showing option value sensitivity to time and price  
-  Observations using **numerically computed rates of change theta and delta**

---

##  Sample Visualizations

Plots in the notebook include:
- Option price vs. time to expiration
- Option price vs. initial stock price
- Theta vs. time and Delta vs. price for both call and put options
